    <h1 class="h1">History !</h1><br>
    <div class="div1">
        <p>It is believed that Yercaud in the Salem district of Tamil Nadu dates back to the Stone Age, where artifacts have been discovered at the ancient shrine at Shevaroy Hills (also called Servarayan Temple), about 5 km from the Yercaud lake. Sir Thomas Munroe, former governor of Madras, discovered this place in 1842, and the Scottish collector David Cockburn contributed to its development. This makes him known as the Father of Yercaud, and he introduced various plantations here like coffee, pears, and apples. The arrival of more Europeans in the city over the years led to further expansion of the city’s plantations, including tea, cinnamon, etc. It was MSP Rajes, the first Indian coffee planter to settle in the town, who established the famous MSP Plantations and MSP Coffee.</p>
